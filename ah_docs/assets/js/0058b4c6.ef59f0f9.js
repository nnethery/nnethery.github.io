When either line fires too hard, too weakly, or at the wrong time, symptoms appear in whatever territory that line was supposed to regulate. Below is a working map of common conditions (grouped by the specialty that usually sees them) and the usual ANS involvement. Use this as a \\"why ANS?\\" reference.","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"overview/how-is-it-measured":{"id":"overview/how-is-it-measured","title":"How is it Measured?","description":"Measuring the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) has historically been difficult and invasive. For years, the only non-invasive method attempted was Heart Rate Variability (HRV).","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"overview/how-we-challenge-ans":{"id":"overview/how-we-challenge-ans","title":"How Do We Challenge the ANS?","description":"Measuring your ANS at rest is important, but the real test of its health is seeing how it responds\u2014and recovers\u2014from stress. To do this, we use a standardized series of challenges.","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"overview/treatment":{"id":"overview/treatment","title":"How Do You Treat Autonomic Imbalance?","description":"Autonomic imbalance today is rarely \\"one toxin, one pill.\\" It is more like a habit that got reinforced six prongs that keep nudging the ANS back toward balance, three from how you live, three from what you replenish. These prongs come from decades of clinical autonomic practice and mitochondrial support work.","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"overview/wearables":{"id":"overview/wearables","title":"How Can We Do This on Wearables?","description":"Most autonomic tests separate the two branches of the nervous system by measuring heart activity and breathing at the same time. That\'s because the parasympathetic (vagal) signal rides on top of the baseline heart rhythm, and the sympathetic signal sits underneath it, so normally you need two dials to tell them apart. Our problem was: wearables usually only give you one dial \u2014 heart rate.","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"overview/what-is-ans":{"id":"overview/what-is-ans","title":"What is the Autonomic Nervous System?","description":"Your Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the silent, automatic control system for your body.
