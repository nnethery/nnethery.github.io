			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">JOHN RAWLS, <span class="BOLD-ITAL">A Theory of Justice</span><a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber646" id="SuperscriptNumber646"><sup class="endnote">1</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Here’s a quirk about American politics: the majority of white Americans vote for Republicans for president, unless they were born after 1981 or between 1950 and 1954. Why those who were born after 1981 vote differently is easy to understand. They are Millennials or iGen; they lean left on most social issues and many economic ones (as Bernie Sanders discovered). They are less religious than previous generations, and the Republican Party turns them off in a variety of ways. But what’s the story for those born from 1950 to 1954? They strongly favored Democrats through the 1980s and have been roughly evenly divided since then, with a slight lean overall toward the Democrats. (You can see this for yourself, and play with one of the best interactive political infographics ever, by searching the internet for “How Birth Year Influences Political Views.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber647" id="SuperscriptNumber647"><sup class="endnote">2</sup></a>)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why is there a little demographic island of Democrats among white Americans born in the early 1950s? Why do they vote differently in the twenty-first century than their siblings who were born a few years before or after them in the middle of the twentieth century?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The answer might be 1968. Or, rather, the period of emotionally intense national political events of 1968 and the years around it (roughly 1965–1972).<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber648" id="SuperscriptNumber648"><sup class="endnote">3</sup></a> The political scientists Yair Ghitza and Andrew Gelman examined voting patterns of Americans to see whether political events or the political climate in childhood left some kind of mark on people’s later political orientation.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber649" id="SuperscriptNumber649"><sup class="endnote">4</sup></a> They found that there is a window of higher impressionability <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214" title="214"/>running from about age fourteen to twenty-four, with its peak right around age eighteen. Political events—or perhaps the overall zeitgeist as people perceive it—are more likely to “stick” during that period than outside that age range.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Americans born in the early 1950s, all you have to do to evoke visceral flashbacks to 1968 is say things like: MLK, RFK, Black Panthers, Tet offensive, My Lai, Chicago Democratic National Convention, Richard Nixon. If those words don’t flood you with feelings, then do an internet search for “Chuck Braverman 1968.” The five-minute video montage<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber650" id="SuperscriptNumber650"><sup class="endnote">5</sup></a> will leave you speechless. Just imagine what it must have been like to be a young adult developing a political identity, perhaps newly arrived on a college campus, as momentous moral struggles, tragedies, and victories happened all around you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We are in another such era today, and if Ghitza and Gelman are correct, then the events and the political climate of the last few years may influence the way today’s college students vote for the rest of their lives. Suppose you were born in 1995, the first year of iGen. You entered your politically most impressionable period when you turned fourteen, in 2009, just as Barack Obama was being sworn in. You got your first iPhone a year or two later as smartphones became common among teenagers. If you went to college, you probably arrived on campus in 2013, the year you turned eighteen. What were the political events that you and your new friends were talking about, posting about, and protesting about? What were the issues on which you had to stake out your position with your tweets, posts, and “likes”? The government shutdown of October 2013? The long rise of the stock market?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not likely. The interests and activism of teens have far more to do with social issues and injustices than with purely economic or political concerns, and the 2010s have been extraordinarily rich in such issues. The table below shows a small sampling of the major news stories related to what is commonly known as “social justice” in each year since the first members of iGen turned fourteen. In 2009 and 2010, some of the largest news stories in the United States were the ongoing financial crisis, health care reform, and the rise of the Tea Party. You can see that high-profile social justice stories become more numerous in subsequent years, just as the first members of iGen were preparing to go off to college.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216" title="216"/>Important, terrifying, thrilling, and shocking events happen every year, but the years from 2012 through 2018 seem like the closest we’ve come to the intensity of the stretch from 1968 to 1972. And if you are not convinced that the last few years are extraordinary by objective measures, then just add in the amplifying power of social media. Not since the Vietnam War and the civil rights struggles of the 1960s have so many Americans been exposed to a seemingly endless stream of videos showing innocent people—mostly people of color—being beaten, killed, or deported by armed representatives of the state. Today’s college students have lived through extraordinary times, and, as a result, many of them have developed an extraordinary passion for social justice. That passion, which drives some of the changes we are seeing on college campuses in recent years, is our sixth explanatory thread.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This chapter is about social justice. We will explore the meaning of this term and embrace one version of it while criticizing another. The term is a lightning rod in the left-right culture war, so this is a good time for us to lay our cards on the table, politically speaking: Greg identifies as a liberal with some sympathy for libertarian perspectives. Before FIRE, he worked for an environmental justice group; he worked for an organization that advocates for refugee rights and protections in Central Europe; and he interned at the ACLU of Northern California. Jon considers himself a centrist who sides with the Democratic Party on the great majority of issues, but who has learned a lot from the writings of conservative intellectuals, from Edmund Burke through Thomas Sowell. Neither of us has ever voted for a Republican for Congress or the presidency. Both of us share most of the desired ends of social justice activism, including full racial equality, an end to sexual harassment and assault, comprehensive gun control, and responsible stewardship of the environment. We both believe that the way social justice is currently being conceptualized and pursued on campus is causing a variety of problems and engendering resistance and resentment for reasons that some of its advocates don’t seem to recognize. In this chapter, we describe some of these conceptualizations. We also suggest a way to think about social justice that makes it more likely to be achieved and that harmonizes it with the traditional purpose of the university: the pursuit of truth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" title="217"/>What exactly is “social justice”? There is no widely shared definition. We’ll try to draw out its meaning by starting with “justice” and then showing in what ways “social justice” differs, conceptually, and in what ways it is the same.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Intuitive Justice</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Justice is arguably the most important moral concept in the history of Western philosophy. From Plato’s <i>Republic</i> through John Rawls’s <i>A Theory of J</i><i>ustice</i>, philosophers have tried to propose rules and principles that would underlie a fair or “just” society. Rather than review that history here in order to derive a philosophical definition of justice, we’ll take a shortcut and tell you about two major areas of psychological research that, when combined, give us a working definition of people’s everyday, ordinary, or “intuitive” notions of justice. Intuitive justice is the combination of <i>distributive justice</i> (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and <i>procedural justice</i> (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy). We’ll show where claims about social justice fit well with intuitive justice and where they don’t.</p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Sharing plays a big role in the moral lives of children, and they get a lot of practice dividing things equally. If there are four kids and twelve jelly beans, each kid should get three. Obviously. But what do kids do when the jelly beans are a reward for cleaning up the classroom, and one kid did most of the work while another kid did nothing? Even toddlers seem to recognize the importance of <i>proportionality</i>. In one experiment, two-year-olds showed signs of being surprised when two people were rewarded equally if only one of them did any work.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber651" id="SuperscriptNumber651"><sup class="endnote">6</sup></a> By the age of six, kids show a clear preference for rewarding the hard worker in a group, even if equal pay is an option.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber652" id="SuperscriptNumber652"><sup class="endnote">7</sup></a> At young ages, kids have trouble following this intuition when it means that they themselves get less reward, but by adolescence, they are much better at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"/>applying proportionality to themselves.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber653" id="SuperscriptNumber653"><sup class="endnote">8</sup></a> Developmental psychologists Christina Starmans, Mark Sheskin, and Paul Bloom reviewed the research on fairness in children and concluded that “humans naturally favour fair distributions, not equal ones,” and “when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber654" id="SuperscriptNumber654"><sup class="endnote">9</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To be clear, sometimes distributive justice calls for equality. For example, Americans seem to have a common intuition that money inherited from a deceased parent should be divided equally among siblings, rather than trying to assess who did more for the parent or who needs the money more. And sometimes distributive justice calls for inequality; for example, when attending to need, particularly within a family or group that has some communal feeling and that thinks it fair and proper to route resources to whoever needs them most. But as the review by Starmans, Sheskin, and Bloom indicates, proportionality or merit is the most common and preferred principle children and adults use for allocating rewards outside a family.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Proportionality is the heart of “equity theory,” the major theory of distributive justice in social psychology.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber655" id="SuperscriptNumber655"><sup class="endnote">10</sup></a> Its core assertion is that when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants, people perceive that to be equitable, or fair.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber656" id="SuperscriptNumber656"><sup class="endnote">11</sup></a> We can illustrate the theory with a simple equation, shown in Figure 11.1.</p>
			<figure class="w100">
				<div class="w80c">
					<img alt="" class="w100" src="../image/Art_10.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<figcaption>
					<p class="x12-Caption"><span class="Figure-Caption"><span id="FIGURE111"/>FIGURE 11.1.</span> Equity Theory. People keep close track of the ratio of everyone’s outcomes to their inputs. When the ratios are equal, people perceive that things are fair.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The consistent finding in equity theory research is that in most relationships, people keep close track of how much reward each person is reaping (their outcomes, such as pay and perks) in proportion to how much they are contributing (their inputs, such as hours worked and the skills or credentials they bring). They do this more in work relationships and less in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"/>intimate relationships, but even in marriages, people are not oblivious to these ratios, and because of the power of self-serving biases, they often have a sense that they are doing more than their “fair share” of some or all tasks.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber657" id="SuperscriptNumber657"><sup class="endnote">12</sup></a> When everyone perceives that all the proportions are equal, then everyone perceives that things are fair, and harmony is far more likely. When people believe that someone else’s ratio is too high, they are likely to feel resentful toward that person, whose rewards are disproportionate to their contributions. They may also feel resentment toward the boss, company, or system that allows such inequities to persist. People are not just being greedy. An early study testing equity theory found that when people were led to believe that they were being <i>overpaid</i> for a job, they worked harder in order to deserve the pay—to get their ratio back into line.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber658" id="SuperscriptNumber658"><sup class="endnote">13</sup></a></p>
			<h4 class="x05-Head-B">PROCEDURAL JUSTICE</h4>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Intuitive justice is not just about <i>how much</i> each person gets. It’s also about the <i>process by which</i> decisions about distributions (and other matters) are made. The social psychologist Tom Tyler is one of the pioneers of research on “procedural justice.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber659" id="SuperscriptNumber659"><sup class="endnote">14</sup></a> His central finding is that people are much more willing to accept a decision or action, even one that goes against themselves, when they perceive that the process that led to the decision was fair.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There are two basic concerns that people bring to their judgments of procedural justice. The first is <i>how the decision is being made</i>. This includes whether the decision-makers are doing their best to be objective and neutral and are therefore trustworthy, or whether they have conflicts of interest, prejudices, or other factors that lead them to be biased in favor of a particular person or outcome. It also includes transparency—is it clear to all how the process works? The second basic concern is <i>how a person is being treated</i> along the way, which means primarily: Are people being treated with dignity, and do they have a voice—do they get to fully state their case, and are they taken seriously when they do?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tyler’s findings are especially important for understanding how people respond to the police. When people perceive that the police are following fair procedures and treating them and people like them with dignity, they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220" title="220"/>are much more willing to support the police, help them to fight crime, and even accept occasionally being stopped and frisked by the police, whom they see as working to keep their neighborhood safe. But if people think that the way the police select people to frisk is racially biased and that people like them are treated disrespectfully, with hostility, or, even worse, with violence, they will understandably be angry and will see the police as the enemy. In a study published in 2002, Tyler and psychologist Yuen Huo found that white and nonwhite residents of two California cities had similar ideas about what procedural justice entails, but their experiences gave them very different perceptions of how the police treated people. It was this difference that explained racial differences in attitudes toward the police.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber660" id="SuperscriptNumber660"><sup class="endnote">15</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Combining the two forms of justice, we can say this: Intuitive justice involves perceptions of distributive justice (as given by equity theory) <i>and</i> procedural justice. If you want to motivate people to support a new policy or join a movement in the name of justice, you need to activate in them a clear perception, or intuition, that someone didn’t get what he or she deserved (distributive injustice) or that someone was a victim of an unfair process (procedural injustice). If you can’t elicit at least one of those feelings, then people are much more likely to be content with the status quo, even if it is one in which some people or groups end up with more resources or more status than others.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber661" id="SuperscriptNumber661"><sup class="endnote">16</sup></a></p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Proportional-Procedural Social Justice</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Some conservatives and libertarians have argued that “social justice” is a useless term—there is only <i>justice</i>, and tacking on the word “social” adds nothing.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber662" id="SuperscriptNumber662"><sup class="endnote">17</sup></a> We don’t agree. We think there are two forms of social justice identifiable in modern political debates across the Western world, one of which is a subset of intuitive justice and one of which is not.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s a definition of social justice that accords with intuitive notions of justice, from the National Association of Social Workers: “Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social workers aim to open the doors of access and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" title="221"/>opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber663" id="SuperscriptNumber663"><sup class="endnote">18</sup></a> Most Americans would agree that everyone should have equal <i>rights</i> and <i>opportunities</i> and that <i>doors should be open</i> for everyone.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber664" id="SuperscriptNumber664"><sup class="endnote">19</sup></a> Much of the left-right divide on social policy involves how far the <i>government</i> should go to equalize opportunity for children who are born into unequal circumstances (and whether it is the federal government, state governments, or local governments that should be responsible for that equalization).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Using that definition of social justice, we’ll define <i>proportional-procedural social justice </i>as <i>the effort to find and fix cases where distributive or procedural justice is denied to people because they were born into poverty or belong to a socially disadvantaged category</i>. Some of these cases are extremely obvious. The Jim Crow laws of the American South before 1965 were shockingly explicit violations of procedural justice: racist police, judges, and legislatures cruelly disregarded the dignity of black Americans and brutally violated their rights. These violations of procedural justice led directly to egregious violations of distributive justice in almost every area of life, including very unequal public expenditures on separate and vastly unequal schools.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The civil rights campaign was a long struggle for proportional-procedural social justice. Not everyone could see the injustice early on, and many white people were motivated to not see it.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber665" id="SuperscriptNumber665"><sup class="endnote">20</sup></a> This is why common-humanity identity politics—which emphasizes an overarching common humanity while calling attention to cases in which people are denied dignity and rights—was ultimately so effective. It did not try to force white Americans to accept a <i>new</i> conception of justice; it tried to help white Americans to see that their country was violating <i>its own</i> conceptions of justice, which had been so nobly expressed by the Founding Fathers but so imperfectly realized.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In our account, proportional-procedural social justice falls entirely within the larger domain of intuitive justice. That doesn’t mean we should discard the term “social justice.” Some injustices based on race, gender, or other factors (and their intersections) are obvious, but others are subtle, and people who do not experience them can be unaware of them (as Kimberlé Crenshaw noted).<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber666" id="SuperscriptNumber666"><sup class="endnote">21</sup></a> It is useful to have specialists within the domain of justice research who focus on this subset of injustices. Furthermore, when <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222" title="222"/>such injustices are pointed out, members of the majority group are often motivated to ignore or deny them.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber667" id="SuperscriptNumber667"><sup class="endnote">22</sup></a> It is among the most important requirements of a democratic society that it provide a way for people and groups to make new claims about justice. An open democratic society considers such claims, debates them, and then acts on claims that combine compelling arguments with effective political pressure. If the outcome is new laws that are supported by widely shared new norms, as happened in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, that’s pretty much the definition of moral and social progress in a democracy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To take just one example of a subtle injustice: Suppose there’s a high school that is composed of 80% white students and 20% black students. The student committee planning the senior prom must decide what songs to play, and at this school, musical tastes tend to vary by race. The committee takes a vote on how to proceed, and the winning plan is to let students nominate a long list of songs, each of which will then be voted on by the entire student body. Democracy is all about voting, right? And the process itself was decided on democratically, so we have procedural fairness, right?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harvard legal scholar Lani Guinier explored cases like this in her 1994 book, <i>The Tyranny of the Majority</i>.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber668" id="SuperscriptNumber668"><sup class="endnote">23</sup></a> She pointed out that seemingly fair processes can sometimes lead to a group that is in the minority getting entirely shut out at the end of the process. In the high school example above, it’s quite possible that 100% of the songs chosen would be those nominated by the white students. If that example seems trivial to you, just imagine that you’re choosing state legislators instead of songs. Guinier suggested some alternative ways that communities could run elections and divide electoral power, ways that would not exclude or disadvantage minorities.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Guinier’s ideas elicited an angry reaction from some politicians on the right, particularly when she suggested methods that would change the basic system of “one person, one vote per seat.” She was called a “quota queen” in <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber669" id="SuperscriptNumber669"><sup class="endnote">24</sup></a> The controversy surrounding her ideas derailed her nomination to become Bill Clinton’s assistant attorney general for civil rights.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber670" id="SuperscriptNumber670"><sup class="endnote">25</sup></a> But the <i>principle</i> she was elaborating is sound, even if her preferred methods are open to debate. This principle—the need for democracies to protect the rights of minorities—was one of the reasons that the U.S. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223" title="223"/>Constitution’s first ten amendments (the Bill of Rights) were added so quickly. (You don’t need a Bill of Rights to protect the rights of the majority in a democracy, because the vote already does that.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When social justice is about searching for and ending violations of human or civil rights, particularly when those violations are related to membership in social identity groups, then it is about removing obstacles and creating equality of opportunity. It is exactly what those social workers called for when they defined social justice as the quest to “open the doors of access and opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.” Proportional-procedural social justice is <i>justice</i>, and justice is never the enemy of truth. Justice <i>requires</i> truth and honesty, and justice is entirely compatible with the purpose, values, and daily life of a university. But what happens when social justice activists focus on a desired end-state and pursue that goal in ways that <i>violate</i> either distributive or procedural justice?</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Equal-Outcomes Social Justice</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When Jon taught at the University of Virginia (UVA), he sometimes hired members of the UVA men’s crew team to do yard work for him. Each fall and spring, young men on the team put flyers in all faculty mailboxes, advertising their “rent-a-rower” service. At least, Jon <i>thought</i> he was hiring members of the UVA men’s crew team. But after talking to the rowers, he learned that there is no such thing as the UVA men’s crew team. There is only the Virginia Rowing Association. The men who row for the association are all students at the University of Virginia, but the university does not provide funding for their sport. They must each pay more than a thousand dollars a year to belong to the association, and they are also required to participate in the rent-a-rower program in order to raise money for their boats, coaching staff, travel to races, and other expenses. They share a boathouse on the Rivanna Reservoir with the UVA Women’s Rowing Team—for which all expenses, including travel, coaching staff, and snacks at the boathouse, are fully funded by the university.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Why are UVA students who want to row treated so differently based on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224" title="224"/>their gender? Because the implementation of Title IX was changed over the years. From its original goal of providing equal <i>access</i> to educational opportunities for women and men, the program morphed into one that pushes universities to obtain equal <i>outcomes</i> regardless of inputs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On its face, Title IX is eminently fair and reasonable. It prohibits colleges that accept federal funds from discriminating against women with respect to “educational opportunity.” In 1979, the Carter administration used an equal-opportunity interpretation of Title IX when applying it to college sports: scholarships were to be “available on a substantially proportional basis to the number of male and female participants in the institution’s athletic program.” Furthermore, “the governing principle in this area is that the athletic interests and abilities of male and female students must be equally effectively accommodated.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber671" id="SuperscriptNumber671"><sup class="endnote">26</sup></a> Outcomes (such as scholarships and slots on teams) had to be proportional to inputs (such as interest in participating). Men and women should find it equally easy to obtain a sports-related scholarship or a slot on a team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But in 1996, the Clinton administration began to put pressure on schools to achieve equal <i>outcomes</i>.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber672" id="SuperscriptNumber672"><sup class="endnote">27</sup></a> The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a “Dear Colleague” letter (a general directive regarding Title IX compliance) to all schools receiving federal funding,<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber673" id="SuperscriptNumber673"><sup class="endnote">28</sup></a> clarifying how schools could comply with Title IX’s relevant obligations.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber674" id="SuperscriptNumber674"><sup class="endnote">29</sup></a> One compliance option was for schools to show that their sports programs (taken all together) mirrored the gender balance of the overall student body. The letter also offered two other ways to comply,<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber675" id="SuperscriptNumber675"><sup class="endnote">30</sup></a> but in practice, if schools chose those options, they were in a compliance gray zone that invited monitoring and possible investigation by the Office for Civil Rights, so hardly any schools did. Furthermore, with the press and various organizations watching closely, schools would be judged by their overall numbers anyway.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber676" id="SuperscriptNumber676"><sup class="endnote">31</sup></a> Schools therefore began to strive for equal <i>outcomes</i>. Some schools cut men’s sports teams as part of their effort to improve their gender balance, sometimes citing Title IX as the reason for the cuts.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber677" id="SuperscriptNumber677"><sup class="endnote">32</sup></a> More commonly, schools added women’s teams, which is more consistent with the original spirit of Title IX, but that, too, sometimes created unequal treatment. That’s what happened at UVA: before 1994, men’s and women’s crew <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225" title="225"/>had both been club sports—there was no varsity crew program. In its efforts to comply with Title IX, UVA elevated women’s crew to a varsity sport, but did not do the same for the men’s team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Of course, if male and female students had equal levels of <i>interest</i> in participating in sports, then both versions of social justice would converge on the desired end-state of equal outcomes. Give everyone the same <i>access</i> to sports, and your teams will mirror the overall population. Note that “equal outcomes” in these cases doesn’t necessarily mean fifty-fifty; it means representative of the overall student body, which is usually mostly female. “Equal outcomes” means that of all the students who participate in sports, the ratio of men to women will be the same as the ratio of men to women in the student body as a whole. More generally, equal-outcomes social justice activists seem to believe that all institutions and occupations should mirror the overall U.S. population: 50% female, roughly 15% African American, 15% Latino, and so on. Any departure from those numbers means that a group is “underrepresented,” and underrepresentation is often taken to be direct evidence of systemic bias or injustice.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yet men and women differ in their interests on many things, including sports. A review of the literature led by psychologist Robert Deaner, of Grand Valley State University (Michigan), finds that boys and men show greater interest in playing sports and watching sports than do girls and women, and this is true across cultures, eras, and age groups, whether one uses interview methods or observations of play behavior.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber678" id="SuperscriptNumber678"><sup class="endnote">33</sup></a> Of course, those differences could just reflect a pervasive cross-cultural tendency to steer girls away from sports and deprive them of opportunities, but if that were true—if girls were being discouraged from doing what they wanted to do—then sex differences would be smaller in informal settings, such as when kids are playing in a park, compared with school settings. But in fact, the opposite is true. The gender difference is relatively small in school—girls constitute about 42% of the athletes on high school teams—but it is much larger when adolescents are observed in public parks or when they are surveyed about how they use their leisure time.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber679" id="SuperscriptNumber679"><sup class="endnote">34</sup></a> The available research suggests that girls and women are often as interested as boys and men in getting physical exercise, but not in playing team sports.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber680" id="SuperscriptNumber680"><sup class="endnote">35</sup></a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If this is true—if boys and men are more interested, on average, in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226" title="226"/>playing team sports—then universities cannot achieve the equal-outcome target just by offering equal opportunity. They must work harder to recruit women and, perhaps, discourage men. In fact, in order to meet their equal-outcomes targets, many universities are resorting to ethically questionable techniques, known collectively as “roster management,” which sometimes border on fraud. As reported in a 2011 <i>New York Times</i> exposé,<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber681" id="SuperscriptNumber681"><sup class="endnote">36</sup></a> it is very common for schools to pad the rosters of their women’s teams with women who never come to practice and sometimes don’t even know they are signed up. Some schools invite men to practice with the women and then count the men on the women’s team roster. The exposé gives the impression that U.S. universities are sneaky and dishonest institutions, but this is the predictable response of a bureaucracy, as we described in the previous chapter. When the federal government pressures universities to achieve equal outcomes in the face of unequal inputs, administrators do what they can to protect the institution. That might require them to violate procedural justice, distributive justice, and honesty along the way.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You can see the basic problem if you plug the terms into equity theory, as we do in Figure 11.2. At the University of Virginia, men who want to row must contribute much more than women ($1,000 or more per year, plus renting themselves out for labor). Yet their outcomes are less than those received by women (who have a much larger budget). The ratios are far from equal.</p>
			<figure class="w100">
				<div class="w50c">
					<img alt="" class="w100" src="../image/Art_11.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<figcaption>
					<p class="x12-Caption"><span class="Figure-Caption"><span id="FIGURE112"/>FIGURE 11.2.</span> When male rowers must raise their own money, their ratio of outcomes to inputs is much lower than the ratio for female rowers, who are supported by the university.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Of course, if we look at UVA sports as a whole, the picture looks different. The men’s football program is gigantic and costly, and there is no women’s football team. The university as a whole is still spending far more money on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227" title="227"/>men’s sports than on women’s sports, and if you endorse equal-outcomes social justice, you’ll say that the unequal treatment of rowers is necessary in order to compensate for the money spent on male athletes elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But when you leave campus, that argument is not going to convince many people; it’s very hard to make it intuitively compelling by linking it to equity theory or procedural fairness. Most people want <i>individuals</i> to be treated well, and they recoil from cases where individuals are treated unfairly in order to bring about some kind of group-level equality. This is why quotas generally produce such strong backlash: they mandate a violation of procedural justice (people are treated differently based on their race, sex, or some other factor) and distributive justice (rewards are not proportional to inputs) to achieve a specific end-state of equal outcomes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To be clear: Departures from equality sometimes <i>do</i> indicate that some kind of bias or injustice is operating. Some institutions or companies make it harder for members of one group to succeed, as can be seen in recent books and articles about the toxic “bro culture” of Silicon Valley,<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber682" id="SuperscriptNumber682"><sup class="endnote">37</sup></a> which violates the dignity and rights of women (procedural injustice) while denying them the status, promotions, and pay that they deserve based on the quality of their work (distributive injustice). When you see a situation in which some groups are underrepresented, it is an invitation to investigate and find out whether there are obstacles, a hostile climate, or systemic factors that have a disparate impact on members of those groups. But how can you know whether unequal outcomes truly reveal a violation of justice?</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Correlation Does Not Imply Causation</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">All social scientists know that correlation does not imply causation. If A and B seem to be linked—that is, they change together over time or are found together in a population at levels higher than chance would predict—then it is certainly possible that A caused B. But it’s also possible that B caused A (reverse causation) or that a third variable, C, caused both A and B and there is no direct relationship between A and B. (It’s also possible, as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" title="228"/>we described in chapter 7, that it’s a “spurious correlation”—that there is no link between A and B and the correlation is a coincidence.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For example, a study of 7,500 German households found that people who had sex more than four times a week earned 3.2% more than people who had sex only once a week. Sexual frequency and paycheck are correlated (slightly), but why? What’s the causal path? An article about the study that was published at Gawker.com featured this headline: <span class="SCAP">MORE BUCK FOR YOUR BANG: PEOPLE</span><span class="SCAP"> WHO HAVE MORE SEX MA</span><span class="SCAP">KE THE MOST MONEY.</span><a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber683" id="SuperscriptNumber683"><sup class="endnote">38</sup></a> The headline suggested that A (sex) causes B (money), which is surely the best causal path to choose if your goal is to entice people to click on your article. But any social scientist presented with that correlation would instantly wonder about reverse causation (does having more money cause people to have more sex?) and would then move on to a third-variable explanation, which in this case seems to be the correct one.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber684" id="SuperscriptNumber684"><sup class="endnote">39</sup></a> The Gawker story itself noted that people who are more extraverted have more sex and also make more money. In this case, a third variable, C (extraversion, or high sociability) may cause both A (more sex) and B (more money).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Social scientists analyze correlations like this constantly (to the great annoyance of friends and family). They are self-appointed conversation referees, throwing a yellow penalty flag when anyone tries to interpret a correlation as evidence of causation. But a funny thing has been happening in recent years on campus. Nowadays, when someone points to an outcome gap and makes the claim (implicitly or explicitly) that the gap itself is <i>evidence</i> of systemic injustice, social scientists often just nod along with everyone else in the room.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">An outcome gap is a kind of correlation. But if someone quotes from a study or otherwise asserts that one group is overrepresented in a job category or that there is a gap in pay, often the implication is that being a member of one group <i>caused</i> members of that group to be preferentially hired or to be paid more. It would indeed be evidence of improper or illegal discrimination if there were no other reason for the outcome gap aside from group membership. For example, if someone notes that computer programmers at elite tech firms are mostly male, often the implication is that being male <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229" title="229"/><i>caused</i> those employees to be more likely to be hired or promoted, which is obviously unjust if there are no other differences between male and female computer programmers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But are there other differences? Are there other causal pathways? If you suggest an alternative explanation for the gap, others may take you to be saying that the problem is not as severe as the speaker believes it is—and if anyone in the room is displeased by that suggestion, then you may be accused of committing a microaggression (specifically a “micro-invalidation”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber685" id="SuperscriptNumber685"><sup class="endnote">40</sup></a>). If your alternative hypothesis includes the speculation that there could be differences in some underlying factor, some input that is relevant to the outcome (for example, a sex difference in how much men or women enjoy sports or computer programming),<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber686" id="SuperscriptNumber686"><sup class="endnote">41</sup></a> then you may be violating a serious taboo.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In an article titled “The Psychology of the Unthinkable,” social psychologist Philip Tetlock calls this the use of “forbidden base rates.”<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber687" id="SuperscriptNumber687"><sup class="endnote">42</sup></a> But if this kind of thinking is forbidden and social scientists don’t work as hard to challenge the theories that are politically favored, then “institutionalized disconfirmation,” the process of challenging and testing ideas, breaks down. If professors and students are hesitant to raise alternative explanations for outcome gaps, then theories about those gaps may harden into orthodoxy. Ideas may be accepted not because they are true but because the politically dominant group <i>wants </i>them to be true in order to promote its preferred narrative and preferred set of remedies.<a href="31_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber688" id="SuperscriptNumber688"><sup class="endnote">43</sup></a> At that point, backed by the passion and certainty of activists, flawed academic theories may get carried out of the academy and be applied in high schools, corporations, and other organizations. Unfortunately, when reformers try to intervene in complex institutions using theories that are based on a flawed or incomplete understanding of the causal forces at work, their reform efforts are unlikely to do any good—and might even make things worse.</p>

			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">College students today are living in an extraordinary time, and many have developed an extraordinary passion for social justice. They are identifying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230" title="230"/>and challenging injustices that have been well documented and unsuccessfully addressed for too long. In the 1960s, students fought for many causes that, from the vantage point of today, were clearly noble causes, including ending the Vietnam War, extending full civil rights to African Americans and others, and protecting the natural environment. Students today are fighting for many causes that we believe are noble, too, including ending racial injustices in the legal system and in encounters with the police; providing equal educational and other opportunities for everyone, regardless of circumstances at birth; and extinguishing cultural habits that encourage or enable sexual harassment and gender inequalities. On these and many other issues, we think student protesters are on the “right side of history,” and we support their goals. But if activists embrace the equal-outcomes form of social justice—if they interpret all deviations from population norms as <i>evidence</i> of systemic bias—then they will get drawn into endless and counterproductive campaigns, even against people who share their goals. Along the way, they will reinforce the bad mental habits that we have described throughout the book.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Instead, we urge students to treat deviations from population norms as invitations to investigate further. Is the deviation present in the pipeline or applicant pool for the job? If so, then look at the beginning of the pipeline more than at the end of it, and be willing to entertain the possibility that people of different genders and people from different cultures may have different preferences. Focus as much on procedural justice as on distributive: Are people in all identity groups treated with equal dignity? The answer to that question might be no in an organization that has achieved statistical equality, and it might be yes in an organization in which some groups are underrepresented. Be clear about what end states matter and why. As long as activists keep their eyes on the two components of intuitive justice that all of us carry in our minds—distributive and procedural—they will apply their efforts where they are likely to do the most good, and they will win more widespread support along the way.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231" title="231"/>In Sum</h3>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">Political events in the years from 2012 to 2018 have been as emotionally powerful as any since the late 1960s. Today’s college students and student protesters are responding to these events with a powerful commitment to social justice activism. This is our sixth and final explanatory thread.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">People’s ordinary, everyday, intuitive notions of justice include two major types: distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">The most common way that people think about distributive justice is captured by equity theory, which states that things are perceived to be fair when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">Procedural justice is about how decisions are being made, and is also about how people are treated along the way, as procedures unfold.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">Social justice is a central concept in campus life today, and it takes a variety of forms. When social justice efforts are fully consistent with both distributive and procedural justice, we call it <i>proportional-procedural social justice</i>. Such efforts generally aim to remove barriers to equality of opportunity and also to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity. But when social justice efforts aim to achieve equality of <i>outcomes</i> by group, and when social justice activists are willing to violate distributive or procedural fairness for some individuals along the way, these efforts violate many people’s sense of intuitive justice. We call this <i>equal-outcomes social justice</i>.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Correlation does not imply causation. Yet in many discussions in universities these days, the correlation of a demographic trait or identity group membership with an outcome gap is taken as evidence that discrimination (structural or individual) <i>caused</i> the outcome gap. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t, but if people can’t raise alternative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232" title="232"/>possible causal explanations without eliciting negative consequences, then the community is unlikely to arrive at an accurate understanding of the problem. And without understanding the true nature of a problem, there is little chance of solving it.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This concludes Part III of this book. In these six chapters, we showed how the new culture of safetyism that we described in Part I and the dramatic events that we described in Part II are the result of many intersecting trends and explanatory threads that all came together in recent years. These threads reach back into history, down into childhood, and out into national politics. Having offered this explanation of how we got here, we now turn to the question of where to go next.</p>
